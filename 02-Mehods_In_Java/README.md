# Keywords and Expressions

1. We can't create variable names with keywords in java

# Methods in Java:

1. Methods need to be defined inside a class
2. We can't have named method inside another method. (Unlike javascript)

(In JS, we can define function inside another function)

### Default values for parameters

1. In many languages, methods can be defined with default values, and you can omit passing values for these when calling the method.
2. But Java doesn't support default values for parameters.
3. There are work-arounds for this limitation, and we'll be reviewing those at a later date.
4. But it's important to state again, in Java, the number of arguments you pass, and their type, must match the parameters in the method declaration exactly.
