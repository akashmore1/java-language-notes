# Arrays

1. An array is a data structure that allows you to store a sequence of values, all of the same type.
2. You can have arrays for any primitive type, like ints, doubles, booleans, or in fact, any of the 8 primitives we've learned about.
3. You can also have arrays for any class.
4. Elements in an array are indexed, starting at 0.
5. If we have an array storing five names, conceptually, it looks as shown here.
   | Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
   | Stored values in an array with 5 elements | "Andy" |"Bob" | "Charlie" | "David" | "Eve" |
6. The first element is at index 0 and is Andy.
7. The last element in this array is at index 4 and has the String value Eve.
